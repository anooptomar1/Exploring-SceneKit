An app created to explore the features of SceneKit, an iOS framework. [What is SceneKit?](https://developer.apple.com/reference/scenekit "What is Scenekit?")
> SceneKit combines a high-performance rendering engine with a descriptive API for import, manipulation, and rendering of 3D assets. Unlike lower-level APIs such as Metal and OpenGL that require you to implement in precise detail the rendering algorithms that display a scene, SceneKit only requires descriptions of your sceneâ€™s contents and the actions or animations you want it to perform.


### Description

The app contains three example. In each one of them multiple features of SceneKit has been explored. The main features tested in this app are:
* loading of assets using art assets and Model I/O
* loading of Collada files from SCNAssets folder
* rendering capabilities (lighting models and techniques)
* animation and interaction supported

#### Scene 1
The first scene contains some meshes generated using the ones already integrated in SceneKit. This one is able to render sphere, plane, box, pyramid, cone, cylinder, capsule, tube and torus. In this scene we use SCNSphere and SCNBox customized with some physic property to simulated different collision behavious and interaction.

#### Scene 2
In the second scene I try to import a model, lights and camera from a collada file created with Blender. I added some animation using CAAnimation to move the camera in the scene. All textures are automatically loaded within the model.
